        <span class="big-O">O</span>bservations from space tele- scopes like
        JWST do not show us how or when stars and galax- ies formed. Rather,
        these observations simply tell us what they look like. The
        interpretation of these images is driven by a scientist’s worldview.
        Everyone has a worldview built on only one of two options: God’s Word or
        man’s word. Our worldview largely influences our scientific predictions.
        It’s an important characteristic of a good scientific model to make cor-
        rect, specific predictions. The incredi- ble findings from the JWST have
        made shockwaves in the secular astronomy community—causing secular
        scientists to totally rethink their models. Mean- while, these findings
        have been con- sistent with predictions made by bib- lical creationists,
        which is no surprise because we have the advantage of build- ing our
        models on the infallible Word of God. Looking at the predictions and the
        worldview behind them allows us to see how a biblical creation worldview
        better explains the evidence we’re seeing in the far-flung recesses of
        our universe.

        Most secularists in the science com- munity believe in naturalism,
        explain- ing the existence of the universe only by natural laws, absent
        of supernatural intervention. In their naturalistic ori- gin story
        called the big bang, the uni- verse began around 13.8 billion years ago
        when space and energy appeared in a very hot, dense state before grad-
        ually cooling and expanding into the universe we see today. When secular
        scientists are studying images taken by the JWST, they’re interpreting
        the data through their natural- istic worldview. They believe the first
        stars (called population III stars) formed around 300 million years
        after the big bang, corresponding to a redshift of about 14. In general,
        the farther the dis- tance of a galaxy, the more its visible light is
        shifted into the infrared (red- shifted). In other words, the farther
        the distance, the higher the redshift value.

        As the story goes, those stars were then gravitationally attracted to
        form the first galaxies and gradually matured into large spiral-shaped
        or elliptical-shaped galaxies. Secularists also believe population III
        stars contained only hydrogen, helium, and a little bit of lithium.
        Therefore, no elements heavier than lithium should exist in the earliest
        stars. As their story goes, these population III stars eventu- ally got
        large enough to fuse lighter ele- ments in their cores, producing
        heavier elements (such as carbon and oxygen). And when these stars
        exploded, the heavier elements spread out into space, allowing the next
        generation (popula- tion II) stars to contain some amount of these
        heavier elements. Secular scientists also believe that the light from
        the most distant galax- ies takes billions of years to reach us on the
        earth. Consequently, they claim to be seeing the formation of the first
        gal- axies from billions of years ago. Based on their naturalistic
        beliefs, secular scientists had three main pre- dictions for what the
        JWST would find:

        No galaxies with a redshift value higher than roughly 14 (begin- ning
        around 300 million years after the big bang) and to find relatively few
        galaxies approach- ing that distance. The earliest stars in the process
        of forming and assembling into unstructured galaxies (irregularly shaped
        with very low mass). A steady decrease in heavy ele- ments with
        increasing redshift, and the most distant (earliest) stars being
        population III stars (containing no elements heavier than lithium).

        Rather than relying on fallacious assumptions about the past, it’s
        always better to start with a historical, eye- witness account. And the
        Bible is that account—the true history book of the universe beginning in
        Genesis. When we start our thinking with God’s Word, we know stars (and
        galaxies) were supernaturally created by our almighty God on day four of
        creation week, around 6,000 years ago (Genesis 1:14– 19). That is, stars
        and galaxies did not form gradually over billions of years— they were
        formed at God’s command when “he made the stars also.”
