          Since becoming fully operational in 2022, the James Webb Space
          Telescope (JWST) has been collecting some of the most breathtaking
          images of the heavens ever seen. Roughly the size of a tennis court,
          this $10-billion observatory is the largest and most powerful
          telescope ever built. The deep field image of a galaxy cluster, called
          SMACS 0723, is just one example that displays the glory of our God
          (Psalm 19:1). This is by far one of the most intriguing clusters,
          showing many “mature” galaxies at distances much farther than secular
          scientists predicted.
